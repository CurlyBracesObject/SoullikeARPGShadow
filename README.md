Background:
Soullike ARPG Shadow
As a milestone in the ARPG genre, Soul-like games have produced many well-known titles that have been recognized. Elden Ring won the 2023 TGA Game of the Year award for its outstanding design and innovation. Inspired by these classics, our team decided to create an ARPG game with a cyberpunk near-future worldview, aiming to combine the core features of Soul-like games with unique cyberpunk elements to bring players a new experience.
In the game design, we borrowed heavily from the map design concept of Souls-like games. Souls games are known for their intricate map layouts and high degree of freedom of exploration, which allow players to immerse themselves in the game world and experience unique adventures. Therefore, we have incorporated a lot of vertical stereoscopic map elements into the level design, making the whole game world more three-dimensional and multi-layered.
Cyberpunk near-future worldview
Our game is set in a cyberpunk-style near-future metropolis where the contrast between high-tech and low-life is striking, with neon-lit skyscrapers and dark alleyways. Players take on the role of a character on a special mission as they embark on an adventure in a city full of crises and opportunities.
Vertical stereoscopic map design
In order to enhance the exploratory and challenging nature of the game, we have adopted a vertical three-dimensional structure in the map design. Not only can players explore freely on the ground, but they can also enter the underground world in various ways or climb to the top of a tall structure. This design not only enriches the game's scene and layering, but also increases the depth and fun of exploration.
Core gameplay features
Difficult Combat: Continuing the difficult combat style of Souls-like games, enemies will have highly intelligent and diverse attack methods, and players will need precise controls and strategies to defeat strong enemies.
Free exploration: With an open-ended map design, players can freely choose the path to explore and discover hidden secrets and treasures.
Cyberpunk Elements: Combining cyberpunk-style visuals and technological elements, the game will have a wealth of futuristic technological equipment and transformation systems.
Character development: Diverse character development paths, players can choose different skills and equipment according to their preferences, creating a unique fighting style.
In-depth storyline: With a fascinating storyline and rich world viewing, players will gradually uncover the truth of the game world through the main quest and side quests.
epilogue
By combining the core features of the Souls genre with a cyberpunk near-future worldview, we wanted to create an ARPG that was both challenging and creative, bringing players a new gaming experience. Whether it's the thrill of combat or the freedom of exploration, we're committed to creating an unforgettable game world.
